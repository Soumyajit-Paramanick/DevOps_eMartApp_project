# üõí Emart Microservices Project (DevOps Practice)

This project is a hands-on implementation of a microservices-based e-commerce application using Docker and Vagrant. It was built to learn and practice the fundamentals of containerization, networking, orchestration, and troubleshooting in a production-like environment.

The architecture follows a microservices model with separate containers for:
- Frontend (Nginx)
- Backend application (Java/Tomcat)
- Database (MySQL)
- Cache (Memcached)
- Messaging Queue (RabbitMQ)

## üìå Project Objectives

- Understand microservices architecture
- Learn Docker and Docker Compose
- Simulate deployment in a Vagrant-managed VM
- Handle container orchestration and networking
- Practice real-world troubleshooting
